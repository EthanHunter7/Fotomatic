# Fotomatic Project From Codecademy 

This project was made with HTML/CSS. 

I was given some files with code already started and I had to find the problem within the code and add more thing to help make the website responsive to different devices and screen sizes. 

I was also given a Mockup for the web page which showed what different elements needed to be and the different sizes for elements depending on the device. 

If you have a look at the different commits the first one was the code I was given at the start and the second commit is all the changes and additions I made to get it to respond to different devices and resizing in a browser.
